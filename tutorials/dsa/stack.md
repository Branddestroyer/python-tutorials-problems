# Stack

### A stack is a linear data structure that stores items in a Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) or First-In/Last-Out (FILO) manner. In stack, a new element is added at one end and an element is removed from that end only.


Think about the things you can do with such a pile of plates

Put a new plate on top
Remove the top plate
If you want the plate at the bottom, you have to first remove all the plates on top. Such kind of arrangement is called Last In First Out - the last item that was placed is the first item to go out.
